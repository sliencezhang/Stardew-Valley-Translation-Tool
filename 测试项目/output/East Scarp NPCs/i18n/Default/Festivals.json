  "festivals.eloise.spring13.y2": "I helped paint the eggs this year! Look for the ones with little birds on them. They're mine.$1",
  "festivals.jacob.spring13": "Hello @. Eloise loves birds, but she's never been particularly interested in the egg hunt. I'm not really sure why.",
  "festivals.jacob.spring13.y2": "Spring is certainly a busy time of year, isn't it? I feel guilty having a day off, but celebrating festivals with family is more important.$1",
  "festivals.eloise.spring13.emyn": "Do you think fairies are like hummingbirds? They can flap their wings fifty times per second?! I wonder how many times a fairy flaps their wings?",
  "festivals.josephine.spring13": "What a whimsical celebration! I'll have to take a photo in that rabbit; Guvvie will be most amused.$1",
  "festivals.josephine.spring13.y2": "Such a charming small town tradition. It's a pity Guvvie couldn't join us... but he's a very busy man.$2",
  "festivals.oliver.spring13.false": "Hey there! I'm totally just here for the food. And this punch! It's wicked-good. You should try some.#$e#What do you mean I shouldn't be drinking it? Why? What's wrong with it?$4#$b#Oh... Please don't tell Mom, okay?$2", //

  "festivals.kataryna.spring13": "So far three people have stopped to say 'hi', one's asked about the next edition and only two have given me the stink-eye, so I'm calling that a win.$1",
  "festivals.abyss.spring13": "* Abyss glares at you. Possibly he doesn't approve of egg hunting. *",
  "festivals.beatrice.spring13": "It is so lovely to watch the children having such fun. And the adults too!",

  "festivals.tori.spring13": "Hi @. Will you be participating in the egg hunt today?#$e#Good luck! I believe in you.$1",
  "festivals.aideen.spring13": "Isn't this the most splendid weather for an egg hunt? Not that I shall be joining in the egg hunt, of course.#$e#Oh no, not because it's undignified! Mayor Lewis has disqualified me from participating. Apparently I am fiendishly competitive.$7",
  "festivals.spring13.juliet": "Hey farmer, you gonna chase after the eggs? Me? Nah. I think I'd rather hang back and check out the talent.$1",
  "festivals.spring13.jessie": "Hello @. You know, it would be nice if the kids could win the egg hunt.$1#$e#But Abigail? She has a very competitive spirit, that lass.",
  "festivals.spring13.jasper": "The egg festival holds great spiritual significance; the world is being reborn anew.$1",

  // flower dance
  //*************
  "festivals.aideen.spring24": "Folk dancing? How very rustic. This bears little semblance to the dances I attended in Grampleton. Now, those were sophisticated affairs.",
  "festivals.aideen.spring24.y2": "As rustic as this dance may be... well, I would be disinclined to refuse a potential suitor.$4",
  "festivals.beatrice.spring24": "This festival, it always gets me a little emotional, @.$2#$e#Raoul and I, we used to dance together. Ah, to be young again, and in love.$1",

  "festivals.oliver.spring24": "Nah, I'm not hiding! I'm the welcoming committee!#$e#Yeh, I volunteered for the job, if only to get out of the dancing!$1",
  "festivals.rosa.spring24": "This spring air is so fragrant! I should buy some flowers to brighten up the inn.",
  "festivals.rosa.spring24.y2": "It's fun watching people dance together, but Lewis is so old fashioned... I'd like to dance with a girl, y'know?$2",
  "festivals.tori.spring24": "Ask someone to dance? Oh, no, I couldn't possibly... I'll just stay here and enjoy the music.$2",
  "festivals.tori.spring24.y2": "Ask someone to dance? Oh, no. What if they said 'no'?$2#$b#Or worse! What if they said 'yes'?$4",
  "festivals.vivienne.spring24": "Oh yes, it's lovely to watch the young ones dance, but where's the dance for us geriatrics?#$b#We could show them a thing or two, I reckon!$1",
  "festivals.spring24.juliet": "How quaint, everyone's all paired neatly off. Wanna shake it up a bit, @?$1",
  "festivals.spring24.jessie": "It's lovely to see everyone gathered together, but a little overwhelming too.",
  "festivals.spring24.jasper": "Dancing is not my forte. Two left feet, is how my dear mother once described me.$4",
  "festivals.spring24.jasper.9914": "A celebration of love and fertility. I hope I am not expected to dance.$1#$b#People might laugh. Although I suppose I could always do the unhip-hop!$3",

  "festivals.spring24.tristan.y2": "Oh, I'm keeping an eye on Marlon. There's someone he wants to ask to dance, but he's too shy - so, typical hero, he's looking for monsters instead.",
  "festivals.spring24.jade": "I wish someone would dance with me...$3",
  "festivals.spring24.jade.spouse": "I'm happy to dance with you!$1",

  "festivals.spring24.Kataryna": "Do you know this festival is based around an ancient ritualistic dance?#$b#Careful how you tread, @, it might awaken something primeval.",
  "festivals.spring24.kataryna.spouse": "Hey darling, ready to be swept off your feet?$1#$b#I'm sure we can figure out the steps together.$4",
  "festivals.spring24.corwin.CorwinFlirt": "Fancy a whirl 'round the dance floor, babe?$8#$b#Hey, it's you or I'm gonna ask ol' Roddy here to accompany me.$1",
  "festivals.spring24.corwin.CorwinNoFlirt": "Hey @, wanna help a man out here?$3#$b#I'm tryin' to convince Roddy here to ask Beatrice for a dance... even threatened to dance with 'er meself if he don't!$1",
  "spring24.clint.postemily": "You know? I'm glad no one's going to ask me to dance. I'd probably make a fool of myself anyway.$2", //Clint
  "festivals.spring24.ethan": "You found me! Don't tell Mom, okay? She'll tell me off for getting dirt on my suit.$2",
  "festivals.spring24.edith": "Michael and I used to go clubbing a lot, back in Zuzu. That was before Stella came along, of course.",
  "festivals.spring24.michael": "Believe it or not, pal, I used to be able to bust quite a few moves in my younger days.#$e#Now, though? All I can do is make Ethan cringe. Where is he, anyway?",
  "festivals.spring24.dale": "Hey @. Social gatherings like this are what bring communities together.#$e#Life's not about wealth, you know, it's about connections.",
  "festivals.spring24.valkyrie": "*Valkyrie doesn't love dancing, but she does love attention and snacks.*$4",

  "festivals.tristan.summer28.spouse": "Romantic? Well, I suppose it might be if the whole town hadn't come down to watch them.#$b#Okay, I admit it, they're kinda pretty.#$b#Perhaps we could sneak away somewhere?",
  "festivals.summer28.corwin": "There's all sorts of legends 'bout these critters, @. Some say they're the spirits of the drowned.$2",
  "festivals.summer28.edith": "They're such pretty little things! I think they would prove quite the drawcard to the valley, don't you?",
  "festivals.summer28.michael": "I would've preferred a quiet picnic on the beach... but they don't come near the East Scarp shore.#$b#And Eddy does need to spread her social butterfly wings.$1",

  "festivals.summer28.dale": "Huh, looks like Clint's got new shoes.#$b#Nah, I ain't gonna say anything to him about them. Don't want him to think I'm weird, looking at people's footwear, and all that.",
  "festivals.summer28.valkyrie": "*Valkyrie is sad to see the end of summer*$2",
